Thank you soo much MoolTatvam team for this Assignment, I have tried my best to match my output with your given design
and i have also tried to make it responsive as much as possible.

Steps:
1. Download Zip Folder
2. in the root directory run "npm i" command to download all the dependencies
3. in the root directory run "npm run dev" this command will run tailwindcss

then with the help of live server extension you can have a look on output, i hope you'll like it
